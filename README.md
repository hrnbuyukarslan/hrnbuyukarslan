# 👋 Hi, I'm Harun
**Embedded Systems Engineer | Space Systems & RF | SDR | CubeSat | Ground Stations**

I design, build, and test **hardware–software integrated systems** with a strong focus on  
**embedded electronics, RF communication, and space-related technologies**.

My work spans from **bare-metal microcontrollers** to **SDR-based ground stations**, combining
low-level engineering discipline with system-level thinking.

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Working On

- 🛰 **CubeSat & Space Systems**
  - CubeSat subsystem design (OBC, RF, power, payload concepts)
  - Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS) architectures
  - Full-duplex VHF/UHF RF chains and SDR pipelines

- 📡 **RF & SDR**
  - SDR-based receivers/transmitters (AD936x-class architectures)
  - Signal processing, modulation & demodulation experiments
  - Antenna concepts, RF front-end design, and link analysis

- 🔧 **Embedded Systems**
  - STM32, ESP32, RISC-V based systems
  - Sensor integration, low-power designs
  - Bare-metal and RTOS-oriented development

- 🛠 **Systems & Infrastructure**
  - Linux-based embedded environments
  - DevOps & containerized toolchains for engineering workflows
  - Kubernetes fundamentals (CKA-focused hands-on labs)

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

- Hardware first, software disciplined
- Datasheets > assumptions
- Measurable, testable, repeatable systems
- Designed for failure, debugged for reality

I enjoy working at the intersection of:
**electronics · RF · software · space systems**
